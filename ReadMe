# <Employees>

## Description

-This is a way that a manager can look at all of their employees, they will be able to find an employee depending on role, name, or department.

- I wanted to create a way to help managers manage employees.
- I wanted to be able to make an easy way for a manager to find employees in their system
- It solves being un organized with employees.
- I learned a lot in this homework and its my favorite so far being able to create a database and find it easily was my favorite part though
